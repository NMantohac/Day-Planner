Description:
  - A day planner that contains time blocks of a standard day and allows the user to input text, and save it after clicking on the save
    button and refreshing the page. The hours and date are dynamic, which means they change according to the current date and the 
    time-block hours of the day.
  - The day planner and the website is done through HTML, CSS, and Javascript code in Visual Studio Code, and utilizes
    Bootstrap with its components and utilities. The css file contains standard css practices and media queries (to change the look
    of the day planner on mobile screens). There are two javascript files, in which the first javascript file is the Moment.js library, 
    whereas the second javascript file contains variables (const/let), functions, onclick events, for-loops, and if-else statements for
    the actual day planner.
  
 Technologies:
  - Visual Studio Code
  - HTML, CSS, Javascript/jQuery
  - Bootstrap
  - Moment.js
  
  Challenges:
  - This definitely took a step back in difficulty compared to the last two homeworks because I think I'm getting more used to writing
    code in Javascript/jQuery and doing the logic for it. Overall, it wasn't a really challenging homework, but I had trouble with time
    management due to the fact that I spent most of my time on the previous homework. Nevertheless, this homework was a fun and good
    experience. 
  - There were a few difficulties such as the local storage (which I'm still not really used to), and the logic behind the hours, as 
    well as accurately displaying them. I had to read up on documentation, questions/answers on stackoverflow, and some examples in 
    order for me to understand them and write the code to make them work.
  - There's really not much that I learned other than the stuff regarding this homework, such as the use of moment.js and hour display.
  - I was able to solve each of my problem through continuous effort, patience, and using my online resources!
